Hexabots
========

This project may eventually turn into a turn-based strategy RPG similar
to Final Fantasy Tactics. For now, it includes a simple level editor and
a very simple game that lets you move around and fight with the enemy
team.


Requirements
------------

Panda3D 1.5.4


Editor Instructions
-------------------

The editor has the following keyboard commands:

c: create new level
s: save level
l: load level
d: delete level (clear from memory, not the disk)

You can zoom in and out by turning the mouse wheel, or rotate the view
by clicking the mouse wheel and dragging.

There are also mouse buttons on the screen that you can use to switch
modes so you can edit different things:

Height
Material
    Grass
    Stone
    Water
Character
    Team1
    Team2

When Height mode is active, clicking a tile will allow you to drag it up
and down to change its height.

When Material mode is active, you can paint with the selected material.

When Character mode is active, clicking a character will allow you to
drag it around to a new tile. Clicking an empty tile will create a
character from the selected team on that tile. Clicking the tile under a
character will delete the character from that tile.


Game Instructions
-----------------

l: load level

You can zoom in and out by turning the mouse wheel, or rotate the view
by clicking the mouse wheel and dragging.

The light blue hexes indicate which tiles you can move to. Click a tile
to move there. Moving takes time; the farther you move, the more you
will have to recharge (rest) before you can take your next turn.

The red hexes indicate which tiles are within your attack range. Click
an enemy character when it's within your attack range to queue an
attack. Characters do not attack right away; it takes time to prepare
for the attack.

Taking damage reduces a character's efficiency, which (for now) just
reduces the rate at which a character charges up between turns. The
slower a character charges, the less often that character will get to
take turns. When a character's efficiency reaches 0, that character is
removed from the game.

Defeat all the characters who aren't on your team to win the game.
